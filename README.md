## How to Run the Project

1. **Install Dependencies:**

   Before running the project for the first time, it's necessary to install dependencies. Open the command prompt or terminal in the project's root directory and run the command:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This command installs all the required packages listed in the package.json file.

2. **Compile TypeScript Code:**

If you prefer to run the TypeScript compilation using "Tasks: Run Build Task" in Visual Studio Code, you can follow these steps:

    - Open Visual Studio Code.
    - Click on the "View" tab at the top and select "Command Palette" or use the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+P.
    - Enter "Tasks: Run Build Task" and select this option.
    - Choose "build" and confirm.
    - This way, you can compile TypeScript directly from the Visual Studio Code interface.
